# Ring Quest

### A simple tile-based exploration game built using the Microsoft XMP Framework and C#

Most of the work I put into this project was behind the scenes, creating systems that come baseline in most game engines.

Forgive the low quality of the assets, as this project was focused entirely on building up a framework for the game. I only created the assets that I needed, and didn't put much effort into making them look nice. However, I still want to show off the project because I am proud of the effort I put into making the framework for this game, even if finished product isn't very impressive.

## Notable Features
- Built without a traditional engine
- Custom code for managing nested UI elements
- Procedurally generated map
